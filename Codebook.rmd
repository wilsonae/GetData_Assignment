## Project Description
This project was carried as part of the programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The experiments were carried out using a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) whilst wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the Samsung's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
"The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See the 'features_info.txt' for more details."

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
- download the raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- unzip the downloaded file to your working directory.  This will create a subdirectory called *"UCI HAR Dataset"* in your working directory.
- copy [*run_analysis.R*](https://github.com/wilsonae/GetData_Assignment/blob/master/run_analysis.R) from this repo to your working directory.  Note: do not copy it to the "UCI HAR Dataset" subfolder.
- execute *run_analysis.R*
- on completion, a file, *feature_means.txt*, that contains the tidy data will be written to your working directory.  This file will have 2,310 rows and four columns.  Each observation in this file will have four variables (activity, subject, feature, mean) which are described below.
- if required, the tidy dataset can be read into R using the read.table command.

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. A complete description of how the cleaning is carried out is in this [Readme](https://github.com/wilsonae/GetData_Assignment/blob/master/README.md) file.

##Description of the variables in the feature file
 - The tidy dataset, *feature_means.txt*, consists of 2,310 observations and four variables
 - Each observation consists of four pieces of data as described below.

###Variable names
|Column   | Name  | Type | Valid values | Description |
| :------------: |:---------------:| :-----:| :-----| :-----|
| 1 | activity | Factor w/ 6 levels | WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING | This is the activity. |
| 2 | subject |   int | in the range 1:30 | ID number of the subject |
| 3 | feature | Factor w/ 66 levels | See the list below |One of the xx features being examined |
| 4 | mean | num | -1 <= x <= 1 | The mean of all observations for this activity, subject and feature |

###Variable 1 (activity)
The activity variable indicates what 'exercise' that the subject was carrying out when the measurements were being taken.  
- The activity variable is a Factor w/ 6 levels
- The activity variable can be any one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
- It does not have a unit of measurement

###Variable 2 (subject)
The subject variable indicates which subject was carrying out the activity for this observation.
- The subject variable is an int
- The subject variable can be any integer between 1 and 30
- It does not have a unit of measurement

###Variable 3 (feature)
The feature variable indicates that 'exercise' that the subject was carrying out when the measurements were being taken.  
- The activity variable is a Factor w/ 66 levels
- The activity variable can be any one of the 66 values in the table below
- It does not have a unit of measurement

####Notes on variable 3:
Complete details of the meaning of these variable names are given in the features-info.txt file that is in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in your working directory.  For example, *tBodyAcc-mean()-X* denotes a time domain signal 

###Variable 4 (mean)
The mean variable is the calculated mean of all the original observations for the current activity, subject and feature.
- The activity variable is a num
- The mean variable can take any real number, x, in the range -1 <= x <= 1
- the unit of measurement depends on the corresponding feature
  - if the feature contains the string "acc", the unit of measurement is *metres per second per second*
  - if the feature contains the string "gyro", the unit of measurement is *radians per second*.

In addition to the basic installation of R, this program uses that R packages *"dplyr"* and *"tidyr"*.
