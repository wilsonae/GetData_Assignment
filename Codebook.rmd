The codebook for this course project should include the name of each variable (after any tidying) and a brief definition of its purpose at a minimum. The other sections you should have in a good codebook are an overview section about the source of the data as well as a synopsis, a data dictionary section explaining any naming conventions used for the variables and the aforementioned variable names and definitions. The codebook must provide enough information about the tidy dataset you are submitting so another person reading the codebook would understand the contents of the tidydata dataset file(s). 

## Project Description
This project was carried as part of the programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
From the readme.txt file that accompanied the data:

The experiments were carried out using a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) whilst wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the Samsung's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).
"The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details."

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
- download the raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- unzip this file to your working directory.  This should create a subdirectory called "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory.
- copy [run_analysis.R]() from this repo to your working directory 
- execute run_analysis.R
- on completion, a file, feature_means.txt, that contains the tidy data will be written to your working directory.  The file will have 10,299 rows and four columns.  Each observation in this file will have four variables (activity, subject, feature, mean) which are described below.

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. [link to the readme document that describes the code in greater detail]()

##Description of the variables in the feature file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset
 - 

The tidy data files consists of **10299** rows and four columns.  Each is one observation containing four pieces of data as follows:

|Column  | Name  | Type | Description |
| :------------: |:---------------:| :-----:| :-----|
| 1 | activity | Text | This is the activity.  
| 2 | subject |   Integer | ID number of the subject |
| 3 | feature | Text | One of the xx features being examined |
| 4 | mean | Real | The mean of all observations for this activity, subject and feature |


(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.

Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.

##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
