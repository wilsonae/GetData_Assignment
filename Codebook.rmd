Some parts of this codebook come from both the assignment instructions and from the readme files associated with the data.

The codebook for this course project should include the name of each variable (after any tidying) and a brief definition of its purpose at a minimum. The other sections you should have in a good codebook are an overview section about the source of the data as well as a synopsis, a data dictionary section explaining any naming conventions used for the variables and the aforementioned variable names and definitions. The codebook must provide enough information about the tidy dataset you are submitting so another person reading the codebook would understand the contents of the tidydata dataset file(s). 

## Project Description
This project was carried as part of the programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The experiments were carried out using a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) whilst wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the Samsung's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
"The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See the 'features_info.txt' for more details."

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
- download the raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- unzip this file to your working directory.  This should create a subdirectory called "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory.
- copy [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/wilsonae/GetData_Assignment/blob/master/run_analysis.R) from this repo to your working directory 
- execute run_analysis.R
- on completion, a file, feature_means.txt, that contains the tidy data will be written to your working directory.  The file will have 10,299 rows and four columns.  Each observation in this file will have four variables (activity, subject, feature, mean) which are described below.

###Cleaning of the data
Short, high-level description of what the cleaning script does. A complete description of how the cleaning is carried out is in this [Readme](https://github.com/wilsonae/GetData_Assignment/blob/master/README.md) file.

##Description of the variables in the feature file
General description of the file including:
 - The tidy dataset consists of **10299** observations and four variables
 - Each observation consists of four pieces of data as described below.

###Variable names
|Column / variable  | Name  | Type | Valid values | Description |
| :------------: |:---------------:| :-----:| :-----| :-----|
| 1 | activity | Text | WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING | This is the activity. |
| 2 | subject |   Integer | in the range 1:30 | ID number of the subject |
| 3 | feature | Text | See the list below |One of the xx features being examined |
| 4 | mean | Real | -1 <= x <= 1 | The mean of all observations for this activity, subject and feature |



###Variable 1 (activity)
The activity variable indicates what 'exercise' that the subject was carrying out when the measurements were being taken.  
- The class of the activity variable is 
- The activity variable can be any one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
- It does not have a unit of measurement

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

###Variable 2 (subject)
The subject variable indicates which subject was carrying out the activity for this observation.
- The class of the subject variable is 
- The subject variable can be any integer between 1 and 30
- It does not have a unit of measurement

####Notes on variable 2:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

###Variable 3 (feature)
The feature variable indicates that 'exercise' that the subject was carrying out when the measurements were being taken.  
- The class of the activity variable is 
- The activity variable can be any one of the 66 values in the table below
- It does not have a unit of measurement

####Valid values for the feature variable

tBodyAcc-XYZ, ... **use names() to get the list**

####Notes on variable 1:
Details of the meaning of these variable names are given in the features-info.txt file that is in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in your working directory.  For example, *tBodyAcc-mean()-X* denotes a time domain signal 


###Variable 1 (activity)
The activity variable indicates that 'exercise' that the subject was carrying out when the measurements were being taken.  
- The class of the activity variable is 
- The activity variable can be any one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
- It does not have a unit of measurement

####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.

If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
